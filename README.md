## 📂 Featured Project

### 🔹 [Cloud Vendor REST API](https://github.com/siddharth0161820/cloud-vendor-rest-api)  

A production-ready REST API built with Java and Spring Boot to manage cloud vendors.

- Implements **CRUD operations** with **layered architecture** (Controller, Service, Repository).
- Uses **JPA/Hibernate** to interact with MySQL for persistent data storage.
- Applies **DTOs** with validation annotations to ensure secure and accurate data exchange.
- Features **global and custom exception handling** for consistent, robust error responses.
- Integrated **Spring Security with JWT** for stateless, token-based authentication and authorization.
- Thoroughly tested using **Postman** to validate API endpoints and reliability.
- Designed for **scalability, security, and clean code maintenance** in backend development.
